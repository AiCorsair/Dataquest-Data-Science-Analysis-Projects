This dataset originates from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, which recorded various patient characteristics, including age and chest pain, to classify the presence of heart disease in individuals. This is a prime example of how we can use machine learning to solve problems that have a real impact on people's lives.\n",

Specifically, we'll use a dataset that [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) partially cleaned to facilitate binary classification. The original dataset, which contains multiple classes, can be downloaded from the original website. Moreover, the target variable in the original dataset is named `num`.\n",
