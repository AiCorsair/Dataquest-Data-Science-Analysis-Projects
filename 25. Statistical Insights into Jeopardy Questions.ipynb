    "*Jeopardy* is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years and has become a major force in popular culture. Imagine we want to compete on *Jeopardy* and are searching for any advantage to help us win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of *Jeopardy* questions to identify patterns that could give us an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, named `jeopardy.csv`, contains `19,999` rows from the start of a full *Jeopardy* question dataset, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/). Each row represents a single question from a specific episode of *Jeopardy*. Below are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Show Number` – the episode number of *Jeopardy*. \n",
    "- `Air Date` – the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- `Round` – the round of *Jeopardy*.   \n",
    "- `Category` – the category of the question.   \n",
    "- `Value` – the dollar amount the correct answer is worth. \n",
    "- `Question` – the text of the question.\n",
    "- `Answer` – the text of the answer.\n",

    "Before confirming which terms correspond to high-value questions using a chi-squared test, we first categorized the questions into high-value and low-value groups. We analyzed the frequency of specific terms in both categories by selecting a random sample and comparing the results. Of the `10` randomly chosen terms, `50%` appeared only in low-value questions, while the other half were found in high-value questions.\n",

    "We then calculated the expected counts for these `10` terms and their chi-squared statistics. None of the terms showed a significant difference in usage between high- and low-value questions, with the lowest p-value being `0.119`. Additionally, because the frequencies of the selected terms did not exceed `3`, the chi-squared test's validity was diminished. A more meaningful analysis would involve applying the chi-squared test to terms with higher occurrences."
