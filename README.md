# Dataquest-Projects

This repository stores guided projects completed while learning data science concepts with Dataquest. I worked on a variety of projects using tools such as **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, practicing data cleaning, analysis, visualization, web scraping, and working with APIs, as well as data modeling and forecasting.

The primary data science libraries I used include **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Requests**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-Learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**. In machine learning, I applied various regression, classification, and clustering algorithms (e.g. **OLS**, **Ridge**, **Lasso**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, **K-Means**). In deep learning, I focused on building neural networks using both the **Sequential** and **Functional** APIs.

If you'd like to work on any of the available projects, be sure to find and download the project files from the `Datasets` folder, which contains **CSV**, **Data Base**, and **SQL Text** files.
